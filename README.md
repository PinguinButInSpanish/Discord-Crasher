-------------------------------------------------
After you installed name the video file you want to use to crash their discord with as lol.mp4 then run the file called "RunMe!.bat". Then you should get a file called enjoy.mp4 you can rename this file to what ever you want.

-------------------------------------------------
If there is no file enjoy.mp4 you didnt install ffmpeg correctly or altered with the code.

-------------------------------------------------
NOTE : This has a chance of working it depends how long the video is because it doubles the time they also need to watch till the video freezes so do some testing on your own!
